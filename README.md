# ATM app built with PHP

This app is responsible for validating customer account details and performing basic operations including balance
inquiries and cash withdrawals. The app receives data from a third party in an agreed upon format.

Two test input text files are saved in the folder testInput, so that a test output can be produced.

To test the app, run the following command in the terminal from the root folder:

```
$ php index.php testInput1.txt
```

Or test the second test input like so:

```
$ php index.php testInput2.txt
```
